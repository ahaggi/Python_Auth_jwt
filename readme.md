
Install project dependency:
    Make sure you are connected to <venv_name>, the cmd prompt should look like " ( <venv_name> ) c:\something " , and install the dependencies declared at the "requirements.txt". 
    "requirements.txt" contains a list of items to be installed using pip install like so:
    `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


In our case we changed the virtual enviroment path for this project, so activate it sa:
        `E:\WindowsUserProfile\Desktop\prosjekter\ProjPy\Envs\venv1\Scripts\activate`
        NOTE: in case if you're using "Powershell", you may encouter the fleg err:
            "...Scripts\activate.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system..."
            In that case change the "ExecutionPolicy" as follows:
            `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process`

Connect a project with the virtual environment
    `setprojectdir "<project_path>" `

This project is structured as "Flaskâ€™s Application Factory"
    https://hackersandslackers.com/flask-application-factory

Run the project:
`python .\wsgi.py`

securing flask-api with jwt

JWT: HEADER.PAYLOAD.SIGNATURE
HEADER: (encoded base64) anyone can read
PAYLOAD: (encoded base64) anyone can read
SIGNATURE: its value is hased ( base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +  base64UrlEncode(payload)) by HMACSHA256 algorithm and salted with "our-secret-key"

The secret key must be random and only accessible server-side. We can for ex use the Python interpreter to generate a key:
>>> import os
>>> os.urandom(128) 
'=\xa5\x11Oe\x1d\xf3\xbe\xf4u\xf0\x8c\xb8\xf0\x10x\x81\xd6~\x0c\xc8\xd7"\xf2\xae\x8f)\x18T\xfe\xc7\xe2f>\xa9-\xb4\xbc#\x01\x01m\xaf\xf7Z}\xf1P\x92\xb5[\xff\x11\x05\xf4S\xd3\xf4\xdfg\xa3\xa2,Qd\x01 \x1d\xd5\x0b\xb1*ee\x9cD\xe4\xde\x9a\xc1\xbb\x7fb\xbb\xea)\xc1\xe9XH\x8b\xa6vS\x88\xd6uy\xfc\xae\xa2\xa1\xdd\xd1*\x8b\xa9\xc6T\x9aI\x14\xed0+\x8b"\xeb\x9c\x0c\xf7\t\xe1\x04\xc7+!P'

IMPORTANT:
a good practice is to save the key in our virtual-environment, or in the system env.


and then access it within the in ./config.py:
    SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY') # In case the key is stored in our os for ex windows' system-env
    SECRET_KEY = environ.get('SECRET_KEY') # In case the key is stored in our ./.env file


# **Invalidating JSON Web Tokens**

**Not implemented in this project** But you can implement a logout/invalidating mechanism by creating a blacklist.

I too have been researching this question, and while none of the ideas below are complete solutions, they might help others rule out ideas, or provide further ones.

*1) Simply remove the token from the client*

Obviously this does nothing for server side security, but it does stop an attacker by removing the token from existence (ie. they would have to have stolen the token prior to logout).

*2) Create a token blocklist*

You could store the invalid tokens until their initial expiry date, and compare them against incoming requests. This seems to negate the reason for going fully token based in the first place though, as you would need to touch the database for every request. The storage size would likely be lower though, as you would only need to store tokens that were between logout & expiry time (this is a gut feeling, and is definitely dependent on context).

*3) Just keep token expiry times short and rotate them often*

If you keep the token expiry times at short enough intervals, and have the running client keep track and request updates when necessary, number 1 would effectively work as a complete logout system. The problem with this method, is that it makes it impossible to keep the user logged in between closes of the client code (depending on how long you make the expiry interval).

*Contingency Plans*

If there ever was an emergency, or a user token was compromised, one thing you could do is allow the user to change an underlying user lookup ID with their login credentials. This would render all associated tokens invalid, as the associated user would no longer be able to be found. 

I also wanted to note that it is a good idea to include the last login date with the token, so that you are able to enforce a relogin after some distant period of time.

### Introduction

There are basically two different ways of implementing server side authentication for apps with a frontend and an API:

* The most adopted one, is **Cookie-Based Authentication** (you can find an example [here](http://frederiknakstad.com/authentication-in-single-page-applications-with-angular-js/)) that uses server side cookies to authenticate the user on every request.

* A newer approach, **Token-Based Authentication**, relies on a signed token that is sent to the server on each request.

### Token based vs. Cookie based

The following diagram explains how both of these methods work.

![Lifecycle Diagram](./Sessions-vs-JWT.png)

What are the benefits of using a token-based approach?

* **Cross-domain / CORS**: cookies + CORS don't play well across different domains. A token-based approach allows you to make AJAX calls to any server, on any domain because you use an HTTP header to transmit the user information.
* **Stateless (a.k.a. Server side scalability)**: there is no need to keep a session store, the token is a self-contanined entity that conveys all the user information. The rest of the state lives in cookies or local storage on the client side.
* **CDN**: you can serve all the assets of your app from a CDN (e.g. javascript, HTML, images, etc.), and your server side is just the API.
* **Decoupling**: you are not tied to a particular authentication scheme. The token might be generated anywhere, hence your API can be called from anywhere with a single way of authenticating those calls.
* **Mobile ready**: when you start working on a native platform (iOS, Android, Windows 8, etc.) cookies are not ideal when consuming a secure API (you have to deal with cookie containers). Adopting a token-based approach simplifies this a lot.
* **CSRF**: since you are not relying on cookies, you don't need to protect against cross site requests (e.g. it would not be possible to `<iframe>` your site, generate a POST request and re-use the existing authentication cookie because there will be none).
* **Performance**: we are not presenting any hard perf benchmarks here, but a network roundtrip (e.g. finding a session on database) is likely to take more time than calculating an [`HMACSHA256`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code) to validate a token and parsing its contents.
* **Login page is not an special case**: If you are using [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) to write your functional tests, you don't need to handle [any special case for login](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/51).
* **Standard-based**: your API could accepts a standard [JSON Web Token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token) (JWT). This is a standard and there are multiple backend libraries ([.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=JWT), [Ruby](http://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=jwt), [Java](https://code.google.com/p/jsontoken/), [Python](https://github.com/davedoesdev/python-jwt), [PHP](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt)) and companies backing their infrastructure (e.g. [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/custom-login.html), [Google](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount#overview), [Microsoft](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/AzureAD-Node-Sample/wiki/Windows-Azure-Active-Directory-Graph-API-Access-Using-OAuth-2.0)). As an example, [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/custom-login.html) allows their customers to use any authentication mechanism, as long as you generate a JWT with certain pre-defined properties, and signed with the shared secret to call their API.

>  What's JSON Web Token? **JSON Web Token** (**JWT**, pronounced *jot*) is a relatively new token format used in space-constrained environments such as HTTP Authorization headers. *JWT* is architected as a method for transferring security [*claims based*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity) between parties.

## Implementation

Asuming you have a node.js app, below you can find the components of this architecture.

### Server Side

Let's start by installing `express-jwt` and `jsonwebtoken`:

    $ npm install express-jwt jsonwebtoken

Configure the express middleware to protect every call to `/api`.

    var expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
    var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

    // We are going to protect /api routes with JWT
    app.use('/api', expressJwt({secret: secret}));

    app.use(express.json());
    app.use(express.urlencoded());

The angular app will perform a POST through AJAX with the user's credentials:

    app.post('/authenticate', function (req, res) {
      //TODO validate req.body.username and req.body.password
      //if is invalid, return 401
      if (!(req.body.username === 'john.doe' && req.body.password === 'foobar')) {
        res.send(401, 'Wrong user or password');
        return;
      }

      var profile = {
        first_name: 'John',
        last_name: 'Doe',
        email: 'john@doe.com',
        id: 123
      };

      // We are sending the profile inside the token
      var token = jwt.sign(profile, secret, { expiresInMinutes: 60*5 });

      res.json({ token: token });
    });

GET'ing a resource named `/api/restricted` is straight forward. Notice that the credentials check is performed by the `expressJwt` middleware.

    app.get('/api/restricted', function (req, res) {
      console.log('user ' + req.user.email + ' is calling /api/restricted');
      res.json({
        name: 'foo'
      });
    });

### Angular Side

The first step on the client side using AngularJS is to retrieve the JWT Token. In order to do that we will need user credentials. We will start by creating a view with a form where the user can input its username and password.

    <div ng-controller="UserCtrl">
      <span>{{message}}</span>
      <form ng-submit="submit()">
        <input ng-model="user.username" type="text" name="user" placeholder="Username" />
        <input ng-model="user.password" type="password" name="pass" placeholder="Password" />
        <input type="submit" value="Login" />
      </form>
    </div>

And a controller where to handle the submit action:

    myApp.controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope, $http, $window) {
      $scope.user = {username: 'john.doe', password: 'foobar'};
      $scope.message = '';
      $scope.submit = function () {
        $http
          .post('/authenticate', $scope.user)
          .success(function (data, status, headers, config) {
            $window.sessionStorage.token = data.token;
            $scope.message = 'Welcome';
          })
          .error(function (data, status, headers, config) {
            // Erase the token if the user fails to log in
            delete $window.sessionStorage.token;

            // Handle login errors here
            $scope.message = 'Error: Invalid user or password';
          });
      };
    });

Now we have the JWT saved on `sessionStorage`. If the token is set, we are going to set the `Authorization` header for every outgoing request done using `$http`. As value part of that header we are going to use `Bearer <token>`.

> `sessionStorage`: Although is not supported in all browsers (you can use a [polyfill](https://github.com/inexorabletash/polyfill/blob/master/storage.js)) is a good idea to use it instead of cookies (`$cookies`, `$cookieStore`) and `localStorage`: The data persisted there lives until the browser tab is closed.

    myApp.factory('authInterceptor', function ($rootScope, $q, $window) {
      return {
        request: function (config) {
          config.headers = config.headers || {};
          if ($window.sessionStorage.token) {
            config.headers.Authorization = 'Bearer ' + $window.sessionStorage.token;
          }
          return config;
        },
        response: function (response) {
          if (response.status === 401) {
            // handle the case where the user is not authenticated
          }
          return response || $q.when(response);
        }
      };
    });

    myApp.config(function ($httpProvider) {
      $httpProvider.interceptors.push('authInterceptor');
    });

After that, we can send a request to a restricted resource:

    $http({url: '/api/restricted', method: 'GET'})
    .success(function (data, status, headers, config) {
      console.log(data.name); // Should log 'foo'
    });

The server logged to the console:

    user foo@bar.com is calling /api/restricted

### What's next?

In upcoming posts we will revisit:

* How to handle social authentication?
* How to handle session expiration?

<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 90, 136)"> UPDATE: we published two new blog posts</h3>

* [Token based authentication in realtime frameworks like Socket.io]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/01/15/auth-with-socket-io/)
* [10 Things you should know about Tokens]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/01/27/ten-things-you-should-know-about-tokens-and-cookies/)


### Bottom Line

When building Single Page Applications, consider using a token-based authentication design over cookie-based authentication. Leave a comment or [discuss on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7018529).

### Aside: how it works with Auth0?

Auth0 issue **JSON Web Tokens** on every login. That means that you can have a solid identity infrastructure, including **Single Sign On**, **User Management**, support for **Social**, **Enterprise** and **your own database** of users with just a few lines of code. We implemented a tight integration with Angular: <https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular>
